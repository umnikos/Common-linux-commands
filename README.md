# Common linux commands
Is `adduser` the command to create a new linux user or is it `useradd`? 
How do you make an ssh tunnel, again? 
What was the url of that very convenient website?

Such questions, while simple and common, require you to stop what you were doing 
and scour the internet for the one sentence that interests you.
The [common commands](common-commands.md) file provided by this repo thereby aims to be
the most convenient place to answer questions in as few sentences as possible.
It contains what I have personally found useful as a reference and I hope you find it useful, too!

### Adding new sections
If you've recently found yourself going to the 2nd page of google just to answer a basic question, consider adding what you have found to the file! 
It doesn't actually need to be a command, as long as it is useful as a quick reference. 
You are also allowed to just submit a link to the article that finally answered your question if the answer cannot reasonably be condensed.

### Improving old sections
Fixes of erroneous commands and typo corrections are all welcome! 
Clarifications are also good as long as they do not lengthen the text too much.
